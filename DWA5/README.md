Division Calculator
This is a simple web-based calculator that performs division operations between two input values. It checks for valid inputs, handles various error scenarios, and displays the division result.

Features
Accepts two input values: dividend and divider.
Performs division calculation when the form is submitted.
Validates input values and displays appropriate error messages.
Handles critical errors and provides instructions to reload the page.
Usage
To use the division calculator, follow these steps:

Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Enter numerical values for the dividend and divider in the input fields.
Click the "Calculate" button or press Enter to submit the form.
The division result will be displayed below the form if the inputs are valid.
If either input is empty, an error message will be shown.
If either input is not a number, a critical error message will be displayed, and the page should be reloaded.
If the divider is less than 0, an error message will be shown.
Development
If you want to modify or enhance the code, here are some details:

The main code logic is in the script.js file.
The form element and result element are selected using the [data-form] and [data-result] attributes, respectively.
Event listeners are added to the form's submit event to handle the division calculation and error handling.
Helper functions are defined to display the division result, error messages, and critical error messages.
The isNumeric function checks if a value is numeric.
